# Class Reminder (Posted on 5th June)

@everyone Just a reminder to stay ahead of the class and start warming up with the links above.

If you're done with all of these things, I'd suggest the following:

- Creating a mini website in HTML/CSS.
- Creating an account on GitHub.
- Trying to push your code to GitHub.
- Creating a small backend that can interact with your frontend.

I want to emphasize that none of these are prerequisites, but if you have the time, you should stay ahead of the class and do them.

## Hard TODOs

- Convert your HTML/CSS website to a React project.
- Deploy your frontend on the internet using Netlify/Vercel.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need assistance!

Happy coding!
